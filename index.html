      <p class="rules">To celebrate reaching the milestone of your first project we're going to play "Never Have I Ever!" Make a table of various experiences and milestones you have experienced or hope to in an html table. One column will have a check mark area to tick off the ones you have done, and the other colum will be experiences. The higher your score, the better! Remember to have fun!</p>
